# A-Hard-Year
A Hard Year is a game about a Virtual Ecosystem set in the Mojave desert. The objective is to keep two populations (Yucca Plants and Yucca Insects) alive until the end of the year. Along the way there will be multiple events that could cause the eradication of each population and it is the players job to use the resources available to them to keep the ecosystem safe.
