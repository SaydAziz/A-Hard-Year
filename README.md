# A-Hard-Year
A Hard Year is a virtual ecosystem simulation written in .NET. The objective is to keep two symbiotic populations (Yucca Plants and Yucca Insects) alive until the end of the year. Along the way there will be multiple events/threatening organisms that could cause the eradication of each population and it is the player's job to use the resources available to them to keep the ecosystem safe.
